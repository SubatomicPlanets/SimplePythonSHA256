# SimplePythonSHA256
A simple implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm in Python.<br/>
This is a simple implementation that is not optimized at all. If you would like better performance, you can try hashlib.sha256 or other alternatives.<br/>
This was a simple one-day practice project and was not tested a lot. If you would like to understand SHA-256 better or look at a simple implementation, then this is for you.
